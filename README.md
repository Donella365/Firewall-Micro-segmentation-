# Firewall-Based Microsegmentation 

In this project, I'm implementing micro-segmentation using firewalls. I am utilizing micro segmentation as a part of my implementation of zero trust. 



Tools Used:

VirtualBox (for virtualization)

Ubuntu Server (as the OS for both VMs)

iptables (built-in firewall utility in Linux)

draw.io ( for network diagramming)
